**Task :** build a simple linear regression model to predict delivery time using sorting

**Summary :** 
I build a simple linear regression model using :
+ ols method
+ LinearRegression

I used ols to understand some basic terms like R-squared, adj. R-squared,  AIC, significance of p-value. 
Further I build model using LinearRegression. The techniques I used in building model are - LeaveOneOut, Kfold, train_test_split to compare all these with the same dataset.

**Conclusion :**
+ Models build using ols and LinearRegression have approximately same accuracy in the line of 60's.
+ All the three techniues - LeaveOneOut, Kfold, train_test_split give approximately same accuracy.
+ Accuracy remain in the line of 60's because we use a very small dataset (21 records)
